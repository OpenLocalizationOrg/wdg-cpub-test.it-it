# VAT info


If you’re required to provide a VAT ID number during the Dev Center registration process, here’s some info to get you started.

## Understanding VAT numbers


A value added tax (VAT) number is an identifier used for countries or regions in the European Union. For more info, see the European Union’s official [VIES site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=258372).

## Accepted formats for VAT numbers


Note that Microsoft doesn’t provide tax advice, and the following table is provided only as guidance. You should check with your local tax authorities for any recent changes if this guidance isn’t sufficient for you to provide Microsoft with a VAT number.
