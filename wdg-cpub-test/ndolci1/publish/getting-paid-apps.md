# Getting paid


Here’s some important info you’ll need to ensure that you receive payment for your apps and in-app products (IAPs).

Before you can receive money from app sales in the Windows Store, you need to [set up your payout account and and fill out the necessary tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md) .

## Store fee


When you [sign up for a developer account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615100), you accept the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058). This agreement explains the relationship between you and Microsoft as it pertains to selling apps in the Windows Store, including the Store fee that Microsoft charges for every sale made.

In most cases, the Store fee is 30%. Fees are officially defined in the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058). Always review that document if you have any questions.

The Windows Store fee is applied to all app sales collected by the Windows Store, including IAPs.

## Price tiers


The price tier sets the sales price in all the countries where you choose to distribute your app. You can offer your app for free, or you can pick a price that customers must pay to acquire your app. Price tiers start at .99 USD, with additional increments (1.29 USD, 1.49 USD, 1.99 USD, and so on). The increments between price tiers increase as the price gets higher.

**Note**  These price tiers also apply to any IAPs that you offer from within your app.

 

Each price tier has a corresponding value in each of the more than 60 currencies offered by the Store. We use these values to help you sell your apps at a comparable price point worldwide. However, due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the exact sales amount may vary slightly from one currency to another.

Keep in mind that the price tier you select may include sales or value-added tax that your customers must pay. See [Tax details for paid apps](tax-details-for-paid-apps.md) for more info.

## Payout reporting


You can access details about your payment info and download reports in the **Payout summary** of the Windows Dev Center dashboard. For more about the info shown here, and how we categorize the money you earn, see [Payout summary](payout-summary.md).

## Payout timeframe


Payments are made on a monthly basis (provided the payment threshold has been met), but the date of the month can vary. We’ll generally make your payments around the same time every month, although there may be occasional delays due to various factors.
